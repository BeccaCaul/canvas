#include <stdio.h>

/* Write a program that asks the user for two floating point numbers.
   Print out the value of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
   on the two numbers. Print the answers using two decimal places.
   
   Example:
    Enter your first number: 5
    Enter your second number: 2
    
    5 + 2 = 7
    5 - 2 = 3
    5 * 2 = 10
    5 / 2 = 2.5
    
   Example:
    Enter your first number: 2.3
    Enter your second number: 7.2
    
    2.3 + 7.2 = 9.5
    2.3 - 7.2 = -4.9
    2.3 * 7.2 = 16.56
    2.3 / 7.2 = 0.32
    
   
   Note:
    Make sure you use the correct types for your variables.
    
    Put all your code inside of main. You will need to write main yourself.
