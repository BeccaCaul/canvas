/*
  This program is going to behave like a simple calculator allowing for
  addition, subtraction, multiplication, division on integers
*/

/*
  Write prototypes for four functions called Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide.
  They all take two integers as parameters and return an integer.
*/

/*
  Write the main function here.
  
  1: Read in two ints and a char in the following format:
     operand1 operator operand2
     
     where operand1 and operand2 are ints and operator is a char
     
     Ex:
     2 * 4
     
     operand1 will contain 2
     operator will contain '*'
     operand2 will contain 4
     
  2: Use the value stored in operator to decide which function to call
  
  3: Call the proper function with operator1 and operator2 as the parameters
  
  4: Store the return value from the function
  
  5: Print out the solution to the equation in this format:
     operand1 operator operand2 = answer
     
     Ex:
     2 * 4 = 8

/*
  Write the declarations for the four functions here. Each function will perform
  their operation on the two parameters and return the result.
  
  Example for add:
  1 and 2 are passed to the function
  1 plus 2 equals 3
  return 3

/* Challenges:
  1. Add to another function to calculate an exponent. To calculate an exponent
     the user would use the ^ symbol like this:
     2 ^ 3

  2. Add a function to get the remainder of a division. When the use enters
     an equation for division, print out the division and the remainder:
     
     Input: 7 / 5
     
     7 / 5 = 1 R2
     
     Input: 4 / 9
     
     4 / 9 = 0 R4
