/*
  This program is going to draw a rocket. The rocket
  is divided into 3 parts: cone, middle, engine.
  The cone looks like this:
     *
    ***
   *****
  *******
  
  The middle looks like this:
  -------
  |     |
  |     |
  |     |
  -------
  
  The engine looks like this:
    ***
   *****
  *******
   ** **
*/

/*
  Write three functions that have no parameters and
  returns nothing.
  
  One function will print the cone, one function will
  print the middle and the last will print the engine.
  You may name these anything you want.
  
  Finished rocket:

/*
  Write a main function that will first print the cone,
  then the middle, then the engine. Do not use printf in
  main, use your functions instead!

/* Challenges:
  Get an int as input from the user. Print the middle section
  that many number of times. If the user entered 2, the rocket
  would look like this:

  Get a second in from the user, this number will be how long
  each middle section is. If the user entered 2 for the number of
  middle sections and 2 for the length of the middle sections, the
  rocket would look like this:
