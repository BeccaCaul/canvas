/*
Write a program takes in a month number (1 - 12) then prints the month name
and how many days are in that month. Use 28 days for February.

Example:
Input month number: 1

Month: January
Number of days: 31


Challenge:
Get input for the year as well, and output 29 days for February if it's a
leap year.

Determining if a year is a leap year:
if the year is not divisible by 4, it's not a leap year
if the year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, it is a leap year
if the year is divisible by and by 100, but not divisible by 400, it's not a leap year
if the year is divisible by 4 and by 100 and by 400, it is a leap year
